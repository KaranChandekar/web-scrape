Waypoint Digital,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Hi, my name is Javier Avilés, and I’m the Owner of Waypoint Digital. I started my digital marketing journey while working at a large, well-known digital marketing/print agency in Melbourne, VIC, Australia, in 2010.Over the years, I moved up through the ranks of the organisation (excuse the pun), working in various roles.These roles included designing graphic ads for online digital listing, creating and managing client websites, to managing an entire team of SEO account managers in 2014.At the time, I helped this team of SEOs successfully manage over 100 campaigns Australia-wide. These clients ranged in budget from $500 per month to $10,000 per month.In 2017, I departed this agency and decided to use my knowledge and experience to build my own humble digital offering. This was the birth of Waypoint Digital, and my business continues to thrive to this day. Having secured my first client in September 2017, myself and my team now manage a broad range of SEO, social media and other digital marketing campaigns.I now also have a team of highly experienced and qualified content producers and copywriters on board who have worked for several well-known Australian businesses.Additionally, we design, develop and maintain websites and create stunning graphic designs for branding and digital ads for our clients.Proven Record:Since 2017, Waypoint Digital has continued to grow as a business year after year. My philosophy of putting clients first means I build successful campaigns and, at the same time, develop strong ongoing relationships.Waypoint Digital is currently delivering successful SEO and social media campaigns to both local and international clients. Notably, one of Waypoint Digital’s first clients (located in Essendon, Victoria) has seen an impressive upward trajectory since we took over the reins in 2017.If you have any questions or would like to grab a coffee, please do not hesitate to call me on 0423 345 689 or email me at javier@waypointdigital.com.au"

Install an SEO Plugin. Some options include Yoast for WordPress or an equivalent such as Rank Math or AOISEO, depending on the platform you’re using and your budget. Always remember, though, you get what you pay for! Make sure you have Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T) pages on your site. These include your About, Author Pages, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc. Set up Keyword Tracking for the search terms for which you want to rank. You can do this in Google Search Console and Google Analytics, but some people like to use a secondary tracker such as SEMRush, SEOptimer, or WordStream, both to compare and contrast the results and to build an extra layer of confidence in their test tool suite. Make sure your website is mobile-responsive. Google prioritizes accessibility for mobile searches, so having a mobile-friendly website that works with a broad range of mobile device platforms and programming languages using good mobile SEO is crucial for ranking higher in organic search results!

2 Labs Digital Marketing,,"When I first started in digital marketing, there was no Google but a huge community site called America Online (AOL), this up-and-coming directory called Yahoo, and search engines named Lycos, Infoseek, Excite, WebCrawler, Alta Vista to name a few. A new site called GoTo was launching and it was touted as a new way to advertise on the Internet by means of paying a fee for every visitor that clicked on your ad. Yep, what we now call Pay-Per-Click (PPC). Amazing how things have changed since then. So why the history lesson? Well, it shows how quickly the Internet changes, but most importantly how digital marketing changes. Since 1995, there is one thing that has never changed and that is the sense of accomplishment and pride you feel when your client’s site achieves high rankings from SEO or increases sales, leads, traffic, and overall conversions from the digital marketing campaigns we partner with you on. We invite you to review our site and the services we offer, the case studies we have listed, and get a true sense of who we are at Two Labs Digitial Marketing. If you have any questions, we will be here to answer them so you can make the very best decision for your business. FRANK PIPOLO Co-Owner & Dog Dad"

You see, SEO is like a marketing channel and should be treated as such. Focusing on non-impactful metrics like being on the first page for one keyword is a waste of your time and money.   Instead, it’s most effective to focus on your analytics and boost your ROI. This is what we do best. We help by laying out an SEO campaign and following each task lifecycle, so your team always understands what to do.    How We Serve As SEO experts, we believe SEO is your most important marketing channel. We don’t dilute our expertise with pay-per-click ads, social media marketing, coding, designing, or hosting. Instead, we stay revenue-focused by exclusively creating campaigns using technical SEO, on-page SEO, and off-page SEO services.   Our technical SEO checklist contains over 450 items that could help your ROI, and the list is constantly growing as search engines evolve. We also have specific checklists for certain platforms, like WordPress and React, to ensure that everything works in your favor. Our entire focus is on your revenue.    For your on-page SEO, we’ll dive deep into keyword research and competitor research. Then we precisely optimize each page’s CTR, run diagnostics on your Call To Action elements, and analyze your external links and internal linking.   Off-page SEO focuses on your current backlink portfolio, creating new backlinks, and recovering lost backlinks.   Optimizing these three elements can lead to huge gains for your business.   Your SEO Roadmap SEO evolves every day. We work to effectively navigate around any roadblocks or changes Google makes throughout your campaign. Even with the constant changes to the algorithm, SEO continues to be the most cost-effective way to maximize sales. You’ll understand the exact reasoning behind every action, and what you can hope to gain.   Who We Serve We are selective in whom we serve. We serve people who understand that SEO is a joint effort, and most importantly, understand the value of a fully mapped-out SEO campaign. If it's about you - then you are exactly who we’re here to serve. Just contact us today to learn more about how our SEO services can meaningfully grow your business."

It may be a digital world but it’s the human connection that builds trust. We don’t just get you to your target audience, we help create loyal fans through honest, clever, cutting edge, engaging creative content. We’re often asked about SEO and how to best approach it, and the truth is that it’s often very different depending on who you are, what you’re trying to communicate, and who you’re trying to communicate with. Search engine optimization frames much of how you tell your story, what parts you tell, and where you tell them—the structure, the highlights, and the way you break down chapters. With a coherent and well-planned SEO strategy, you get to decide which parts of your story get the most attention. That’s where we come in."
